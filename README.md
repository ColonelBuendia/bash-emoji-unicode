# bash-emoji-unicode
Yet another unicode and emoji picker

Much of the conent is owed to 
- https://github.com/arp242/uni
- https://unicode.org/emoji/charts-13.0/full-emoji-list.html
- http://www.unicode.org/charts/

I wanted an emoji and unicode picker that worked in the specific way I preferred, and was bash only.
